# Project: Extractive Question Answering using Transformers
Question answering (QA) is a task of natural language processing that aims to automatically answer questions. The goal of extractive QA is to identify the portion of the text that contains the answer to a question. For example, when tasked with answering the question 'When will Jane go to Africa?' given the text data 'Jane visits Africa in September', the question answering model will highlight 'September'.

Phases:
  1. Build a Transformer Network.
  2. Use a pre-trained Transformer model DistilBERT for Question Answering.
